# Bafwiz-Updater: Semi-Automatic Mod Updater
A simple script that took me far too long to write, that once set up, should be be able to detect and then update Minecraft mods when placed in the `.minecraft` folder.
## Currently, here's what it does:
* Downloads the required packwiz dependencies, automatically selecting the correct version for Linux and macOS.
* Creates a backup of the `mods` folder, just in case something goes wrong.
* Creates a new pack on each game launch that overwrites the previous one, which should allow mods to be added and removed within the launcher.
* Automatically detects and updates most installed mods.
* Hides mod metadata files.
## DISCLAIMER: It works and it's kinda awesome :>
Why not download it here and give it a try?
*You may have to chmod it several times for some reason though.*
